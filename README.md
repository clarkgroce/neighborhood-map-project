##Neighborhood Map Project
==========================

This is a project that provided practice using the Knockout.js framework and third party API implementation to create a neighborhood map with location information of places to visit.

Project Goals:
 
* Add a full-screen map using the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/).
* Add map markers of locations on your map, along with information about each location.
* Buid search functionality to search and filter your map marker locations.
* Add relevant content, using third party APIs, to a marker when a search result, list view item or marker is clicked.
* Use the [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) framework to help build the project.

###Viewing the Map:

To view the map, clone it from my github account:

```
git clone https://github.com/clarkgroce/neighborhood-map-project.git
```

and then open index.html in your browser!
